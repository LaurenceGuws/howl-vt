# Protocol Matrix

Owner: `howl-vt`

## Purpose
Summarize `protocol_coverage.db` for random-access protocol status and proof work.

`protocol_coverage.db` is the source of truth. This file is the summary.

The stable day-to-day table is `protocols`, with human-facing protocol names,
sequence shapes, stable unit-test filter names, and three completeness flags:
- `implemented`
- `unit_tested`
- `host_tested`

`unit_test_filters` stores newline-delimited Zig test filter strings for targeted regression runs.

Source provenance remains available through:

- `protocol_sources`
- `protocol_source_items`
- `protocol_source_item_dispositions`
- `protocol_source_links`
- `protocol_aliases`

Useful working views:

- `protocol_gaps`
- `protocol_summary`
- `protocol_learning_inventory`
- `protocol_source_audit`
- `protocol_source_item_disposition_review`

Reference source material lives in `official_docs/xterm/` and `official_docs/kitty/`.

Example query:
```sh
sqlite3 protocol_coverage.db \
  "SELECT id, family, kind, name, sequence FROM protocol_gaps WHERE implemented = 0 OR unit_tested = 0;"
```

Targeted regression query:
```sh
sqlite3 protocol_coverage.db \
  "SELECT id, unit_test_filters FROM protocols WHERE unit_tested = 1 AND unit_test_filters <> '';"
```

Source audit query:
```sh
sqlite3 protocol_coverage.db \
  "SELECT source_id, inventory_state, source_items, linked_items, classified_items, unlinked_items FROM protocol_source_audit;"
```

Disposition query:
```sh
sqlite3 protocol_coverage.db \
  "SELECT disposition, source_id, title, sequence FROM protocol_source_item_disposition_review ORDER BY source_id, source_order;"
```

## Status
- `supported`: parser, action mapping, and grid/input behavior exist with tests.
- `partial`: some layers exist, but behavior is incomplete, dropped, or mode-insensitive.
- `unsupported`: no meaningful handling yet.
- `deferred`: intentionally not in the current tranche.

## Corpus
- Human reference inputs used when curating the ledger:
  - `official_docs/xterm/ctlseqs.html.md`
  - `official_docs/xterm/ctlseqs-contents.md`
  - `official_docs/kitty/*.md`
- Current deterministic fuzzers:
  - `src/fuzz/scrollback.zig`
  - `src/fuzz/protocol.zig`

- `protocols` is the authoritative implementation scope.
- Source material exists for provenance and clarification, not for ongoing
  inventory generation.
- Non-canonical source artifacts are tracked explicitly in
  `protocol_source_item_dispositions`.

## Update Rules
- Keep row status exact.
- Keep `unit_test_filters` runnable.
- Keep notes in current owner names.
- Do not mark a row implemented or tested before proof lands.

## Current Matrix

| Family | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Printable text + UTF-8 stream decode | supported | Parser emits byte-step text/codepoint actions, and `src/parser/events.zig` batches adjacent ASCII text into queued slices deterministically. |
| Basic C0 controls: `LF`, `CR`, `BS`, `HT` | supported | Mapped by `src/xterm/c0.zig` and applied through current screen/host owners. |
| Additional common C0 controls: `BEL`, `ENQ`, `VT`, `FF`, `SI`, `SO`, `SP` | supported | `BEL` and default `ENQ` answerback are no-ops, `VT`/`FF` alias line feed, and `SI`/`SO` switch GL between the supported `G0`/`G1` charset set. |
| Rare C0 controls: `SUB`, `CAN` | unsupported | Not mapped into terminal action behavior today. |
| CSI cursor movement: `CUU`, `CUD`, `CUF`, `CUB`, `CNL`, `CPL`, `CHA`, `VPA`, `CUP`, `HVP` | supported | Covered in action-mapping and screen behavior tests. |
| CSI tab movement: `CHT`, `CBT` | supported | Uses mutable tab-stop state, defaulting to every 8 columns and honoring custom stops set/cleared by HTS/TBC. |
| Tab-stop management: `HTS`, `TBC`, `DECST8C`, custom stops | supported | `ESC H` sets a stop at the cursor, `CSI 0 g` clears current stop, `CSI 3 g` clears all stops, `CSI ? 5 W` restores default 8-column stops, and reset restores defaults. |
| CSI insert/delete/scroll region edits: `IL`, `DL`, `SU`, `SD`, `SL`, `SR`, `DECSTBM` | supported | Covered by regression tests, including horizontal shifts across the active scroll region. |
| Erase in display/line/chars: `ED`, `EL`, `ECH`, `DECSED`, `DECSEL` | partial | Standard `ED`/`EL` modes `0-3` and `ECH` are implemented, including `ED 3` scrollback erase. DEC selective erase now honors `DECSCA`-protected cells. Broader erase/query parity work remains. |
| Rectangular and column edits: `DECCRA`, `DECCARA`, `DECRARA`, `DECFRA`, `DECERA`, `DECSERA`, `DECIC`, `DECDC`, `DECSACE`, `DECRQCRA`, `XTCHECKSUM` | partial | Page-1 rectangular copy/fill/erase/selective-erase, column insert/delete, rectangular-or-stream attribute changes, and rectangular checksum replies are implemented with clipping and overlap-safe copy buffering. Checksum semantics are still conservative and broader rectangle/report surfaces remain pending. |
| Character protection: `DECSCA` | partial | Current-cell protection now gates selective erase behavior, but broader protected-cell interactions are not fully covered yet. |
| SGR text attributes | partial | Supports reset, bold, underline, blink, reverse, ANSI 16, 256-color, RGB fg/bg, underline color, and kitty underline styles. CSI colon separators now track through a Ghostty-like bitset. Missing much of extended xterm attribute surface. |
| DECSTR (`CSI ! p`) | supported | Mapped to `reset_screen`. |
| DEC private modes: `?6`, `?7`, `?25`, `?47`, `?69`, `?1047`, `?1049` | supported | Origin mode, wrap, cursor visibility, left/right margin mode, and alt-screen variants are implemented with DEC-mode query/save/restore coverage. |
| DEC private modes beyond that baseline | partial | High-impact focus/paste/mouse/app-cursor modes exist, and supported DEC modes now answer `DECRQM`. Broader mode families remain unsupported. |
| Locator protocols: `DECELR`, `DECEFR`, `DECSLE`, `DECRQLP` | partial | Locator reporting mode, filter rectangles, button-event selection, explicit locator requests, conservative `DECLRP` replies, and DEC locator status/type reports now work on the host-neutral mouse path. Pixel-perfect host integration and broader locator parity remain pending. |
| ANSI modes and mode reports: `SM`, `RM`, `DECRQM`, `DSR`, `DA`, `DA2`, `DA3`, `DECXCPR`, `DECRQDE`, `DECRQPSR` (`DECCIR`, `DECTABSR`), `DECREQTPARM`, `XTVERSION`, `XTTITLEPOS`, `XTREPORTCOLORS`, `XTREPORTSGR` | partial | `DSR`, `CPR`, `DA`, `DA2`, `DA3`, supported ANSI/DEC `DECRQM`, tracked ANSI `SM`/`RM` modes (`KAM`, `IRM`, `SRM`, `LNM`), displayed extent, cursor-information and tab-stop presentation-state reporting, VT100 terminal-parameter replies, fixed `XTVERSION` identity replies, conservative empty-stack `XTTITLEPOS` replies, conservative color-stack reporting, and conservative rectangle-common `XTREPORTSGR` replies now work. Full presentation-state and broader ANSI-mode families remain unsupported. |
| DCS report/resource queries: `DECRQSS`, `XTGETTCAP`, `XTGETXRES` | partial | `DECRQSS` replies for owned state and invalid requests. `XTGETTCAP` and `XTGETXRES` return explicit conservative invalid replies rather than silent ignore; no host-neutral resource values are exposed yet. |
| String-control transport: `OSC`, `DCS`, `APC`, `PM` | partial | OSC is still buffered to terminator in the parser. APC/DCS/PM parser state is now passthrough-only, and queued APC/DCS/PM payload bytes are owned directly by `src/parser/events.zig`. Unknown APC and PM have no host-neutral action and are intentionally ignored after classification; feature-specific DCS payloads such as SIXEL, ReGIS, DECUDK, and DECRSPS remain separate protocol work. |
| Modern keyboard input: kitty keyboard, `modifyOtherKeys`, `XTFMTKEYS`, `XTQFMTKEYS`, focus and bracketed paste | partial | Kitty keyboard flags, stack/query behavior, focus reports, bracketed paste wrappers, modifyOtherKeys, and xterm key-format resources are implemented. `formatOtherKeys=1` changes ordinary-key modifyOtherKeys emission to CSI-u style. Broader platform-specific key resources remain out of host-neutral scope. |
| Visual metadata: underlines, pointer mode/shapes, notifications, multiple cursors | partial | Kitty underline SGR styles/colors, OSC 22 pointer-shape stacks/queries, OSC 9/99 notification request queueing, xterm `pointerMode`, and kitty multiple-cursor support/empty query/clear controls have host-neutral state or replies. Full extra-cursor placement/color storage and desktop/host UI effects remain open database work. |
| Modern kitty host protocols: clipboard 5522, file transfer, text sizing, unscroll | partial | Kitty clipboard mode/query and OSC 5522 payload capture are implemented. OSC 5113 file-transfer and OSC 66 text-sizing payloads are retained host-neutrally. CSI `+ T` unscroll is parsed into scroll-down behavior. Full host clipboard/file integration, text-size rendering, and scrollback-restoring unscroll remain broader implementation work. |
| ESC single-byte control finals | partial | Parser events preserve ESC finals; DEC save/restore cursor (`ESC 7`/`ESC 8`) is implemented, broader ESC-final semantics remain unsupported. |
| VT52/Tektronix legacy controls | deferred | VT52 cursor/erase aliases and Tektronix plot controls are intentionally outside normal ANSI/VT100 terminal parity until explicit VT52/Tektronix mode ownership exists. |
| Charset designation: `ESC (`, `ESC )`, DEC Special Graphics select | partial | Parser tracks G0/G1 designation and DEC Special Graphics maps through visible cells. Broader charset families remain unsupported. |
| Shift in/out charset use: `SI`, `SO` | partial | G0/G1 GL switching is wired for the supported charset set, including DEC Special Graphics. |
| OSC transport | partial | Parser transports OSC with BEL/ST terminators and parser events now preserve typed OSC command/payload records, including command-only OSC forms such as kitty color stack push/pop. Action/host handling is still narrow. |
| OSC window title/icon title | partial | Parser-event handling recognizes title OSC selectors and `applyLimit(...)` reports the latest queued title payload, but no broader host callback surface exists yet. |
| OSC 8 hyperlinks | partial | OSC 8 drives stable `link_id` cell metadata, `Terminal` URI lookup, render surface propagation, and Linux-host `Ctrl+left click` opening behind explicit policy. Hover polish remains pending. |
| OSC 52 clipboard | partial | OSC 52 surfaces pending clipboard requests and Linux-host applies explicit allow/deny policy. Queries and broader selector behavior remain unsupported. |
| OSC color queries/setters (`4`, `10`, `11`, `12`, etc.) | partial | terminal tracks terminal foreground/background/cursor colors and a 256-color palette. Xterm `OSC 4`, `10`, `11`, `12`, `104`, `110`, `111`, and `112` set/query/reset state. Render/host consumption and the broader xterm dynamic-color family remain pending. |
| DCS transport | partial | Parser events preserve DCS payloads now; action mapping and host integration are still narrow. |
| APC transport | partial | Parser events preserve APC payloads now; kitty graphics action mapping is partially implemented, but general APC host integration is still absent. |
| Kitty colored/styled underlines | supported | CSI subparameter separators are preserved; `SGR 4:0..5`, `58`, and `59` propagate through VT state and text-scene decoration rendering. |
| Kitty keyboard protocol | partial | Negotiation/query/push/pop for progressive flags is implemented with separate main/alternate stacks, and the current host non-text key surface emits Kitty CSI-u/functional forms when flags are active. Text-associated, alternate-key, repeat, and release reporting need richer host events. |
| Kitty graphics protocol | partial | APC `_G` command parsing exists for terminal control keys, `a=q` gets an immediate conservative unsupported reply, direct `t=d` base64 uploads are assembled/stored across chunks, image ids replace prior data, image numbers allocate terminal-owned ids, placements/animation frames are tracked as metadata, and delete selectors cover ids, placement ids, cell/row/column/z intersections, ranges, and frames. Pixel decoding and render plumbing remain unsupported. |
| Kitty shell integration marks | partial | OSC 133 prompt/command/output marks are parsed and latest mark metadata/status is retained host-neutrally. Prompt scrollback navigation and shell integration host behavior remain pending. |
| Kitty desktop notifications | partial | OSC 99 metadata/payload notifications are queued as host-neutral requests. Desktop display, activation/close callbacks, icon/button/sound handling, and alive polling remain pending. |
| Kitty pointer shapes | partial | OSC 22 set/push/pop/query is parsed with separate main/alternate pointer stacks and support/current replies. Applying the shape in host UI remains unverified. |
| Kitty OSC 21 color control | partial | `foreground`, `background`, `cursor`, `cursor_text`, selection colors, and `0..255` palette keys support set/query/reset in VT terminal. Render/host consumption remains pending. |
| Kitty color stack | partial | OSC 30001/30101 now snapshot and restore VT terminal terminal color state, including dynamic colors and the ANSI palette. Render/host consumption remains pending. |
| Bracketed paste mode (`?2004`) | supported | Mode tracking, host paste routing, and paste wrapper emission are wired through `howl-term` and Linux-host. |
| Focus in/out (`?1004`) | supported | Mode tracking, effective host focus routing, and focus report emission are wired through `howl-term` and Linux-host. |
| Mouse tracking (`9/1000/1002/1003/1005/1006/1015`) | supported | X10, normal, button-event, and any-event tracking modes are distinct; legacy, UTF-8 extended, SGR, and urxvt encodings cover press/release/wheel/motion gating with modifiers and DECRQM/save/restore coverage. Host runtime verification is still broader than unit coverage. |
| Application cursor / keypad modes | supported | `?1` application cursor mode changes arrow-key encoding. `ESC =`/`ESC >` and `?66` switch numeric keypad keys between normal characters and SS3 application keypad sequences, with DECRQM/save-restore coverage. |
| modifyOtherKeys / enhanced keyboard reporting | partial | XTMODKEYS/XTQMODKEYS support now tracks `modifyOtherKeys` resource `4`, emits xterm `CSI 27;modifier;code~` reports for printable keys in levels 2/3, and supports disable/query. Other modifier/format resources remain pending. |
| Function/navigation key encoding | partial | Basic xterm-style sequences exist, but not gated by negotiated modes and not extended past current key set. |
| Alt-screen enter/exit and primary scrollback preservation | supported | Explicit tests exist for `1049` save/restore behavior and full-dirty transitions. |
| Snapshot / replay determinism across chunking | supported | Unit/regression/fuzz coverage exists. |

## Proof Rules
Every protocol slice should land with:

1. parser coverage if new syntax is required
2. parser-event coverage
3. action-mapping coverage
4. screen/input/response behavior coverage
5. protocol fuzz seed or regression fixture when behavior is stateful
